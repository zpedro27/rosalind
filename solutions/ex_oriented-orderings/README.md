# Enumerating Oriented Gene Orderings

## Problem

A signed permutation of length n
 is some ordering of the positive integers {1,2,…,n}
 in which each integer is then provided with either a positive or negative sign (for the sake of simplicity, we omit the positive sign). For example, π=(5,−3,−2,1,4) is a signed permutation of length 5.

**Given:** A positive integer n≤6.

**Return:** The total number of signed permutations of length n, followed by a list of all such permutations (you may list the signed permutations in any order).

## Example
**Sample dataset:**
```2```

**Sample output:**
```
8
-1 -2
-1 2
1 -2
1 2
-2 -1
-2 1
2 -1
2 1
```
